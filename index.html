            <h1>VISSION</h1>
            <p>Vision is the ability to close your eyes and imagine a future that not yet exist. It is the ability to see beyond the mess that may be in front of you, to abstract away from it, to clean it up and see a future that does not yet exist.</p>

            <h1>GOAL</h1>
            <p>Goal is the intention of an activity or a plan. In a figurative sense, a goal is the mission of a person or group. A tangible goal could be the net at one end of a soccer field. </p>

           <h1>Without Limits</h1>
           <p> It’s the same with goal achievement. In goal achievement, your skills are your tools. The house is your goal. Just as you need the right tools to build a house, you need the right skills to build your goal. Without the right skills, you will only frustrate yourself, waste your time, and spend a lot of time dealing with rudimentary issues caused by the lack of knowledge or lack of skills, as opposed to progressing in your goal. While difficulty and struggle is part and parcel of any goal pursuit, without the right skills, you find yourself struggling more than necessary. Worse still, this struggle is unconstructive and doesn’t help you move forward..</p>

           <p>It enables countries to work together to fight deadly diseases, cope with disasters, protect the environment, increase food production, and so on. A cultural exchange among nations helps the peoples of the world to understand one another’s cultures and maintain friendly relations.

            As nations are interdependent, a political, social or economic development in one country often has impacts on other countries. This may not always be an advantage, especially if the impacts are produced by developments such as wars, epidemics, and so on.</p>
